# Market-Based-Generator-Cost-Functions-for-Power-System-Test-Cases-used-in-Economic-Studies
Generator cost functions for standard Power System test cases and PJM market generator offer data used to create market-based generator cost functions
This repository contains the following data:
1. PJM generator offer data for the years 2014--2016 (1-day resolution) (.xls)
2. K-means cluster of the generator data based on the four features as described in the paper "Market-Based-Generator-Cost-Functions-for-Power-System-Test-Cases-used-in-Economic-Studies" for the years 2014--2016 (1-day resolution)(.mat)
3. Augmented test cases ready for simulations
